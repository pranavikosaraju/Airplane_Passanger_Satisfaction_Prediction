# Airplane_Passenger_Satisfaction_Prediction
This model predicts passenger satisfaction of an Airlines. I have tried XGBoost, AdaBoost, Random Forest Classifier in this model and the best results are attained by Random Forest. I have used 23 features to make predictions and this can help the airlines to visualise where they need to pick up to attain passanger satisfaction.
